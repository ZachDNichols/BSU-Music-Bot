Attention all musically gifted Beaver fans! BSU Athletics is looking for talented singers to sing/play the National Anthem before home games at all events. If interested, please attend an open casting call that will take place at the BSU GymÂ <span dir=ltr on Monday, October 2 from 7-8 p.m. </span>Please note, this is not limited to pep band and is open to all musicians (singers &amp; instrumentalists). Athletics is open to just about any musical interpretation as long as you present a solid performance.



If you have any questions, I would direct them to the athletics department!





Have a great week!
